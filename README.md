### Random Photo Selector 
#### Background 
To close out our company's Hispanic/Latinx Heritage Month celebrations we like to choose a fun game to play. This year we decided to go with a fun cross of Mexico's Lotería and Bingo. We pulled images across all Latino countries and incorporated items that are shared across the expansive community. 

Several vibrant and exciting tablas(boards) were created in preparation. When we sat down and tried to play, we realized fairly quickly that traditional Bingo rules wouldn't quite work for our game. We decided to take on the Lotería rules and call out photos from a group of XX photos. Since the game will be played virtually without access to a printer, we came to our next roadblock. How are we going to randomly select photos to call?

Python to the rescue, I knew there had to be a way to create a script to randomly select (w/o replacement) images for our game. I also wanted to be able to show the photos that were being called and have them available to call out at the end.
